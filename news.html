                        <h2>Trio Farben</h2><p>Heather Brooks, Imogen Davey, and Georgia Russell have been playing in Trio Farben since 2018, after forming during their studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. In September 2021, they made their Cadogan Hall recital debut, and were awarded Highly Commended in the St. James chamber music prize. Trio Farben are passionate about performing and commissioning new music. ‘Pinpricks in the Sky’ was written for them by Adam Possener, recorded in collaboration with Orchestra For the Earth, poet Milli Dubin and the Big Blue Blueprint. The video was viewed thousands of times all over the world and shared by numerous high profile environmental activists.</p><h3><strong>Tōru Takemitsu - And Then I Knew 'Twas Wind</strong></h3><p>Composed in 1992, this composition belongs to what Peter Burt distinguishes as the final period in Takemitsus creative output. His compositions in the 1990s  develop and exaggerate the late style the composer reached during the late 1970s and 1980s. Here Takemitsu gives full rein to what he called ’Romanticism’: modernist techniques get relaxed, the music has emphasis on melos and has an unapologetically positive outlook in the ’sea of tonality’ that he developed in the 1980s.</p><p></p><h2>Mark Sanders</h2><p>Mark Sanders has had an extensive career being at the forefront of pioneering free-improvisation based work since the late 80’s, as well as often working in theatre, dance, contemporary classical and conceptual art settings. He has a vast discography of more than 100 albums and many more concerts with renowned improvisers such as Roscoe Mitchell, Evan Parker, John Zorn, Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann and Otomo Yoshihide. </p><h2></h2><h2>Oliver Heron</h2><p>Oliver Heron is a pianist, improviser and composer living in London. His training in Jazz led him to be a semi-finalist for the BBC young musician competition in 2020, but since has directed his work towards the fields of non-idiomatic improvising and contemporary composition, studying the latter under Laurence Crane. His practice explores use of preparations and similarly derived sample playback to create an acousmatic blur of timbres, inspired by trailblazers such as Sophie Agnel, John Tilbury and Christian Wallumrød. </p><p></p><h2>Callum Murray</h2><p>Callum is fundamentally concerned with the nature of the aesthetic experience. He believes that artistic creation can teach us valuable lessons about society, politics, language, and metaphysics. His recent work has used computers to create probabilistic, generative, and improvised sounds and images.</p><h3><strong>CONCRETE</strong></h3><p>Concrete is an improvised musical performance, in which found sound material from nature, musical instruments, electronics, and prepared piano heard in the preceding set, are processed by a computer algorithm. This algorithm improvises, along with the performer, to create a concrete - a musical surface which has intricate detail, and is built from an aggregate of many materials.</p>

                        <p>This special event marks the culmination of four years of intense study, exploration, and growth in the world of jazz music.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my time at the Guild Hall School of Music, I have had the privilege of learning from some of the most talented and experienced jazz musicians in the industry. They have guided me in honing my skills, expanding my musical knowledge, and deepening my understanding of the rich history and traditions of jazz.</p>

My education has equipped me with a versatile set of skills, allowing me to navigate through different tempos, harmonies, and improvisational techniques.</p>

                        <p>This final recital is not only a celebration of the past four years, but it is also a platform for me to share with the world the music I have been passionately experimenting with. Through a carefully curated selection of compositions, I aim to showcase my unique musical voice and the creative concepts I have been exploring.</p>

                        <p>Expect an evening filled with captivating melodies, intricate rhythms, and spontaneous musical conversations. With every note played and every improvisation taken, I invite you to join me on this musical journey that has shaped me into the jazz musician I am today.</p>
